This only works if it is the first character in the path: `here/there/~/elsewhere` is not `here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere`.\n",

This is a very efficient way of moving back and forth between directories. The difference between `cd ..` and `cd -` is that the former brings you up, while the latter brings you back.
