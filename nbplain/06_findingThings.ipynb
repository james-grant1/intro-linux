Regular expressions are both complex and powerful; if you want to do complex searches, please look at the lesson on our website. As a taster, we can find lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:\n```bash\ngrep -E '^.o' haiku.txt\n\nYou bring fresh toner.\nToday it is not working\nSoftware is like that.\n```\nWe use the `-E` flag and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell from trying to interpret it.

One option would be to extend tools like `grep` to handle those formats. This hasn't happened, and probably won't, because there are too many formats to support.\n\nThe second option is to convert the data to text, or extract the text-ish bits from the data. This is probably the most common approach, since it only requires people to build one tool per data format (to extract information). On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to do. On the negative side, complex things are usually impossible. For example, it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y dimensions from image files for `grep` to play with, but how would you write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained formulas?\n\nThe third choice is to recognize that the shell and text processing have their limits, and to use another programming language. When the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell: many modern programming languages have borrowed a lot of ideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise."
