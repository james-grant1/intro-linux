Every process also has a default output channel called standard output (or \"stdout\"). A second output channel called standard error (stderr) also exists.

And since we've used `>` to redirect output to a file, the shell connects the process's standard output to that file.\n",

And if we run `wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1`, we get three processes with data flowing from the files, through `wc` to `sort`, and from `sort` through `head` to the screen."

    "This simple idea is why Unix has been so successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other. This programming model is called \"pipes and filters\". We've already seen pipes; a filter is a program like `wc` or `sort` that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way: unless told to do otherwise, they read from standard input, do something with what they've read, and write to standard output.\n",

    "As well as using `>` to redirect a program's output, we can use `<` to redirect its input, i.e., to read from a file instead of from standard input. For example, instead of writing `wc ammonia.pdb`, we could write `wc < ammonia.pdb`. In the first case, `wc` gets a command line argument telling it what file to open. In the second, `wc` doesn't have any command line arguments, so it reads from standard input, but we have told the shell to send the contents of `ammonia.pdb` to `wc`'s standard input."
