We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X), many programmers use Emacs or Vim (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as Gedit. On Windows, you may wish to use Notepad++. Windows also has a built-in editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.\n",

If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or documents directory instead.

However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the **filename extension**, and indicates what type of data the file holds: `.txt` signals a plain text file, `.pdf` indicates a PDF document, `.cfg` is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, `.png` is a PNG image, and so on.\n",

On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.\n",

    "`?` is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This means that `p?.pdb` would match `pi.pdb` or `p5.pdb` (if we had these two files in the molecules directory), but not `propane.pdb`. We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, `p*.p?*` matches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at least one more character (since the `?` has to match one character, and the final `*` can match any number of characters). Thus, `p*.p?*` would match `preferred.practice`, and even `p.pi` (since the first `*` can match no characters at all), but not `quality.practice` (doesn't start with 'p') or `preferred.p` (there isn't at least one character after the '.p').\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the command that was asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the molecules directory (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`. However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design."

    "- `cp old new` copies a file.\n",
    "- `mkdir path` creates a new directory.\n",
    "- `mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory.\n",
    "- `rm` path removes (deletes) a file.\n",
    "- `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.\n",
    "- `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.\n",
    "- Use of the `Control` key may be described in many ways, including `Ctrl-X`, `Control-X`, and `^X`.\n",
    "- The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.\n",
    "- Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."
